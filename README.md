### About Me
- CS major building **strong problem-solving foundations**
- Actively practicing **DSA patterns** for interviews
- Learning **AWS by building and documenting real workflows** 
- Sharing progress publicly to stay consistent and accountable
- I documented the entire AWS learning and reasoning in this [walkthrough demo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nikita-k-302613240_aws-amazonwebservices-iam-activity-7396011764154286080-WID7).


I care more about **depth, consistency, and proof of work** than buzzwords.
